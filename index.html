<h1>Yoga Poses</h1>

Even though we move through the same poses during each yoga class, sometimes I find that I prefer some more than others. Over time, I start to dislike ones I used to love and vice versa. <a href="yoga_poses.html">Click here for some types of poses</a>.

<aside>
Another resource for yoga poses from <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/category/poses/" target="new">Yoga Journal</a>. This website's HTML is organized clearly and has lots of notes so the designer knows why he/she put code in a certain way. The website also organized it using various <code>div</code> and <code>nav</code> tags. There's also good indentation so it's clear where tags begin and end.
