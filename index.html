      <p>
        Software engineer with human resources, event planning, and non-profit experience.
        You can find me learning, breaking, and building with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript,
        HTML/CSS. When I'm away from my precious computer, I'm probably adjacent to
        a mosh pit, at yoga, at Memorial Stadium, or petting dogs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I played around with HTML/CSS during my childhood but always saw it as a pasttime,
        thinking I couldn't be good enough to turn it into a career. When a programming
        bootcamp became a viable option, I fell in love with the craft quickly and the
        transition has been tough but seamless. I'm looking forward to using my
        BA in Art History from UC Berkeley and previous experiences at Boudin Bakery,
        The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, and Novogradac &amp; Company LLP,
        to provide a unique, well-rounded perspective to projects I find meaningful.
